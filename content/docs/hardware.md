The goal for the hardware is to have a fully integrated:

- Microcontroller
- UWB module
- Lights for visual feedback
- Battery management system (for low power consumption)

### Devboards

![Devboard](./images/hardware_devboard.jpg)
We currently have a devboard that is being used for development. The devboard is a custom PCB that has the following components:

- ESP32-C3-MINI-1
- DWM3000
- 2x RGB LED
- USB-C for power and programming

If you are interested in aquiring a pre-built devboard, please contact @abenstirling on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYT2UBpeHM) server. Otherwise the hardware exports are found [here](https://github.com/open-tags/opentag/tree/main/Hardware/devboard_v1_exports), and the BOM is found [here](https://github.com/open-tags/opentag/tree/main/Hardware/bom)
